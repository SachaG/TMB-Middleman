Now that we can create posts, the next step is being able to edit and delete them. While the UI code to do so is fairly simple, it's a good occasion to talk about how Meteor manages user permissions. 

### Template & Controller

Our `post_edit.html` template will be a fairly standard form:

```html
<template name="postEdit">
  {{#with post}}
    <form class="main">
      <div class="control-group">
          <label class="control-label" for="url">URL</label>
          <div class="controls">
              <input name="url" type="text" value="{{url}}" placeholder="Your URL"/>
          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="control-group">
          <label class="control-label" for="title">Title</label>
          <div class="controls">
              <input name="title" type="text" value="{{title}}" placeholder="Name your post"/>
          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="control-group">
          <div class="controls">
              <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="btn btn-primary submit"/>
          </div>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div class="control-group">
          <div class="controls">
              <a class="btn btn-danger delete" href="#">Delete post</a>
          </div>
      </div>
    </form>
  {{/with}}
</template>

```

And here's the `post_edit.js` controller that goes with it:

```js
Template.postEdit.helpers({
  post: function() {
    return Posts.findOne(Session.get('currentPostId'));
  }
});

Template.postEdit.events({
  'submit form': function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    var currentPostId = Session.get('currentPostId');
    
    var postProperties = {
      url: $(e.target).find('[name=url]').val(),
      title: $(e.target).find('[name=title]').val()
    }
    
    Posts.update(currentPostId, {$set: postProperties}, function(error) {
      if (error) {
        // display the error to the user
        alert(error.reason);
      } else {
        Meteor.Router.to('postPage', currentPostId);
      }
    });
  },
  
  'click .delete': function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    if (confirm("Delete this post?")) {
      var currentPostId = Session.get('currentPostId');
      Posts.remove(currentPostId);
      Meteor.Router.to('postsList');
    }
  }
});

```
<%= caption "client/views/posts/post_edit.js" %>

By now most of that code should be familiar. First, we have our template helper that fetches the current post and passes it on to the template. 

We then have two template event callbacks: one for the form's `submit` event, and one for the delete link's `click` event. 

The delete callback is extremely simple: suppress the default click event, then ask for confirmation. If you get it, obtain the current post ID from the Session variable, delete it, and finally redirect the user to the homepage. 

The update callback is a little longer, but not much more complicated. After suppressing the default event and getting the current post, we get the new form field values from the page and store them in a `postProperties` object. 

We then pass this object to Meteor's `Collection.update()` method, and with a callback that either displays an error (if the update failed) or sends the user back to the post's page (if the update succeeded). 

Let's also hook up our router so that we have a way to access our new tempalte:

```js
Meteor.Router.add({
  '/': 'postsList',
  
  '/posts/:_id': {
    to: 'postPage', 
    and: function(id) { Session.set('currentPostId', id); }
  },
  
  '/posts/:_id/edit': {
    to: 'postEdit', 
    and: function(id) { Session.set('currentPostId', id); }    
  },
  
  '/submit': 'postSubmit'
});
```
<%= caption "client/helpers/router.js" %>
<%= highlight "9~12" %>

And add edit links on our posts too:

```html
<template name="postItem">
  <div class="post">
    <div class="post-content">
      <h3><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a><span>{{domain}}</span></h3>
      <p>
        submitted by {{author}}
        {{#if ownPost}}<a href="{{postEditPath this}}">Edit</a>{{/if}}
      </p>
    </div>
    <a href="{{postPagePath this}}" class="discuss btn">Discuss</a>
  </div>
</template>
```
<%= caption "client/views/posts/post_item.js" %>
<%= highlight "5~8" %>

Of course we don't want to show you an edit link to somebody else's form, which is where the `ownPost` helper comes in:

```js
Template.postItem.helpers({
  ownPost: function() {
    return this.userId == Meteor.userId();
  },
  domain: function() {
    var a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = this.url;
    return a.hostname;
  }
});
```
<%= caption "client/views/posts/post_item.js" %>
<%= highlight "2~4" %>

<%= screenshot "8-1", "Post edit form." %>

<%= commit "8-1", "Added edit posts form." %>

### Limiting Permissions

This will be the extent of our client-side code, and it works well.

There's just one problem: nothing is preventing users from modifying or even deleting other people's posts (sure, we're hiding the edit links, but that won't stop a really determined l33t haxx0r).

We can't have that, so we'll set up some more ground rules. First, create a new `permissions.js` file inside `lib` (so that our permissions logic is loaded first, and available in both environments):

```js
// check that the userId specified owns the documents
ownsDocument = function(userId, doc) {
  return doc && doc.userId === userId;
}
```
<%= caption "lib/permissions.js" %>

A while back, we got rid of the `allow()` methods because we were only inserting new posts via a server method (which bypasses `allow()` anyway). 

But now that we're editing and deleting posts from the client, let's go back to `posts.js` and add this `allow()` block:

```js
Posts = new Meteor.Collection('posts');

Posts.allow({
  update: ownsDocument,
  remove: ownsDocument
});


Meteor.methods({
  ...
```
<%= caption "collections/posts.js" %>
<%= highlight "3~6" %>

<%= commit "8-2", "Added basic permission to check the post's owner." %>

### Limiting Edits

Just because you should be able to edit your own posts, doesn't mean you should be able to edit *everything* about them. For example, we don't want users to be able to create a post and then assign it to somebody else. 

So let's use Meteor's `deny()` callback to make sure users can only edit specific fields: 

```js
Posts = new Meteor.Collection('posts');

Posts.allow({
  update: ownsDocument,
  remove: ownsDocument
});

Posts.deny({
  update: function(userId, post, fieldNames) {
    // may only edit the following three fields:
    return (_.without(fieldNames, 'url', 'title').length > 0);
  }
});
```
<%= caption "collections/posts.js" %>
<%= highlight "8~13" %>

<%= commit "8-3", "Only allow changing certain fields of posts." %>

We're taking the `fieldNames` array that contains a list of the fields being modified, and using Underscore's `without()` method to return a sub-array containing the fields that are *not* `url` or `title`. If everything's normal, that array should be empty and its length should be 0. If someone is trying anything funky, that array's length will be 1 or more, and the callback will return `true` (thus denying the update).

#### Method calls vs direct database manipulation client side

To create posts, we are using a `post` method, whereas to edit and delete them, we are calling `update` and `remove` directly on the client, and limiting access via `allow` and `deny`. When it is appropriate to do one and not the other?

When things are relatively straightforward and you can adequately express your rules via `allow` and `deny`, it's usually simpler to do things directly from the client. 

However, as soon as you start needing to do things that should be outside the user's control (such as timestamping a new post or assigning it to the correct user), it's probably better to use a method.
