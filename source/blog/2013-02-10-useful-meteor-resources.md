# Useful Meteor Resources

Taking those first couple steps with a new framework can feel daunting when you don't know where to look. So here are some resources to help you join in:

---

## Getting Started

- The [Meteor Website](http://meteor.com) is a good place to start. Watch the screen casts, get excited, learn about the ecosystem.
- Chris Mather's [Evented Mind](http://www.eventedmind.com/) is an amazing set of screencasts explaining various meteor concepts.
- Gabriel Manricks wrote a [great post](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/whats-this-meteor-thing/) walking through the basic concepts of Meteor.
- Andrew Scala wrote an [awesome introductory walkthrough](http://andrewscala.com/meteor/) (which is a little out of date sadly).
- [Learning Meteor](http://learningmeteor.blogspot.de/) contains some posts working through getting off the ground.

---

## Development

- The [Meteor Docs](http://docs.meteor.com) has all the details on core Meteor's extensive APIs.
- If you need a package that isn't included in core, take a look at [the Atmosphere package repository](http://atmosphere.meteor.com) for a list of 3rd party packages designed to work with the framework.

---

## Questions and answers

- Search [Stack Overflow questions tagged with Meteor](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor) to find answers to technical questions. Be aware that due to the rapidly changing nature of the framework, some older questions and answers maybe not be as relevant.
- The [Meteor Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!forum/meteor-talk) mailing list also contains many questions and answers about thornier topics.

---

## Details

- The [Meteor Core](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!forum/meteor-core) mailing list is devoted to issues about the core meteor platform, if you are interested in getting down to the nitty gritty.
- Reading [the source](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) is a very useful resource; it's well written and (mostly) comprehendible javascript code. It also includes a set of example applications written by the developers themselves.

---

## Notable Applications

- [Made With](http://madewith.meteor.com/) is a list of applications built with meteor (most of the applications are long in the tooth however).
- [Telescope](http://telesc.pe) is a social news platform (build by the authors of this blog!).
- [League](http://beta.getleague.com) lets you organize your sports team.
- [Tunesicle](http://tunes.meteor.com/) is a music app for listening to songs on YouTube.
