/     %p <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> is a Javascript framework for creating <strong>real-time apps</strong>. This means your app automatically gets updated live without the need to ever refresh the browser.

/       %span.caption Telescope
/     %p A while back we launched <a href="http://telesc.pe">Telescope</a>, an open-source social news app (think <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, but real-time). 
/     %p Telescope has since become <a href="https://github.com/SachaG/Telescope">one of the most popular</a> open-source apps built with Meteor. We learned a lot creating it, and we now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to build a solid Meteor app.
/   .block
/     %h3 Whatâ€™s inside the book?
/     %p The book will take you through every step needed to build a full-featured Meteor app, using a simplified version of Telescope as an example. We'll cover things such as:
/     %ul
/       %li Why use Meteor
/       %li How to install and set up the Meteor system
/       %li Building a basic app
/       %li Working with real-time data
/       %li Managing user accounts, authentifications, and authorization
/       %li Real-time UX patterns
