    %h3 What's this Meteor thing?
    / %img.clock{:src => "/images/clock.png"}
    %p <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> is a Javascript framework for creating <strong>real-time apps</strong>. This means your app automatically gets updated live without the need to ever refresh the browser.

    %h3 Why are we writing this book?
    .telescope

      %span.caption Telescope
    %p A while back we launched <a href="http://telesc.pe">Telescope</a>, an open-source social news app (think <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, but real-time). 
    %p Telescope has since become <a href="https://github.com/SachaG/Telescope">one of the most popular</a> open-source apps built with Meteor. We learned a lot creating it, and we now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to build a solid Meteor app.

    %h3 Whatâ€™s inside the book?
    %p The book will take you through every step needed to build a full-featured Meteor app, using a simplified version of Telescope as an example. We'll cover things such as:
    %ul
      %li Why use Meteor
      %li How to install and set up the Meteor system
      %li Building a basic app
      %li Working with real-time data
      %li Managing user accounts, authentifications, and authorization
