# Why Meteor?

We spend a lot of time learning about the "how" of things: how to configure a server, how to use a new CSS property, or in our case how to get started with Meteor.

But what we *actually* want to know is the "why". For example, why should I use that new framework when the current one is already working just fine? After all learning new stuff is always fun, but it also carries its own opportunity cost. 

So let's take a minute to talk about just why we think you should spend your time learning Meteor rather than one of the countless other frameworks and libraries out there.

## Ease of Use

The first reason why Meteor is worth considering is simply its ease of use. You can [get a Meteor app up and running](/2013/01/30/getting-started-with-meteor/) in a matter of minutes, and the whole framework has been optimized for making your life easy.

For example, commonly used Javascript libraries like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) already come bundled with Meteor by default. 

And if you want to use another library or plugin, just drop it anywhere in your project and Meteor will concatenante it, minify it, and load it up automatically. And of course, same goes with CSS.

You can find the same focus on simplicity and ease of use throughout the rest of the framework. So although Meteor is still young, I would not hesitate to recommend it for anybody looking to get into developing for the web.

## All JavaScript

Some people love JavaScript, and some people hate it. But either way, many people *know* JavaScript. 

Even if your programming experience is limited to implementing jQuery carousels, a Meteor app's code should still look familiar. 

What's more, using the same language on both the server and the client removes the need to switch contexts and learn two syntaxes.

And the fact that you can even share the same code between both environments means that client and server become two facets fo the same app instead of separate entities.

## Real-time

Meteor is famous for being a real-time framework, but what you might not realize at first is that real-time is not just about seeing changes happen live in your app. It's also about seeing them happen *automatically*, a.k.a. reactively.

In practice this means that as soon as something changes for whatever reason in your database, the change will be reflected in your user interface without you writing a single line of code. 

Consider something like the "mark all as read" button in an email app. As soon as you click it and the database gets updated, the UI will react without the need for messy callbacks. 

## Smart Team

Meteor is far from perfect. It's still young and hasn't even reach version 1.0 yet. 

But the reason I trust that it will soon get there is because it's being developed by [an amazing team](http://meteor.com/about/people) who can afford to be 100% focused on their product. 

## Cool Name

Come on, admit it. "Meteor" just rocks as a name. I will say that "Python" is pretty bad-ass too, but other than that I don't see many languages or frameworks with awesome names. 

So if you were on the edge about Meteor, hopefully that will be enough to convince you to give it a try!
